When we join in class 6, no one knows each other and  now we became families with the bond that no one can break. We made mistakes,
 we got punishments, we blamed each other but that was the most memorable part of our life. Parties at late nights, talking unneccessarily at 
irrelevent topics and plays as naver before. Although, we have grown up but our childhoodness has still in us and that's the best thing we have.
Our batch did many achivements in different fields either in academis, in sports or in running. Following the achivements that we did are :-
